# JiayiSoftware/RmlUi
This is Jiayi Software's fork of [hyblocker/RmlUi](https://github.com/hyblocker/RmlUi). It features transparency support for the Direct3D 11 backend, and tries to stay up to date with upstream RmlUi. More info on RmlUi itself can be found on their [project website](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/).

This fork drives the user interface component of the J3 framework (unreleased), as well as the menu and HUD for [Equinox](https://github.com/EquinoxHouse), an anarchy utility mod for Minecraft: Bedrock edition.
